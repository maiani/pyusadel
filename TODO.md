# TODO list

## Features
- Getter/Setter for Delta
- Orbital effects
- Mangetic field self-consistency

## Tests
- Add self-consistency test
- Add assemble functions test

## Documentations
- Revise the examples 

## Improvements
- Introduce a smart way to select the number of Matsubara frequencies 
- Check effect of Dynes and tau_ob parameter on the free energy
- Complete the dense version (now the assembly functions are sparse)
- Use numba to speed up the simulations

## Other
- Consider the form of the equation proposed in 10.1103/PhysRevB.94.104518 or the one in this [thesis](https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/ORIG/2/ot51H?_s=cX4Q%2BnhKfmkuzqnZsFoRSwBuoEg%3D)
